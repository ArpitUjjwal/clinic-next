        p1: "Acne is a condition where the tiny holes on your face known as hair follicle get blocked due to certain reasons. Sebaceous glands that are situated just under your skin can cause Acne when they become overactive and secrete excess oil. This excess oil attracts dirt and germs, thus causing a condition like acne. Some other reasons for Acne include abnormal shedding of dead skin cells of your face and proliferation of acne causing bacteria in your face area. Acne treatment in Delhi would help in controlling this condition.",
